# Product Discovery Interview Guide

Script for interactive Q&A sessions. Use conversationally—adapt based on responses.

## Session Opening

**Set context**:
"I'm going to ask you questions to understand the problem space deeply. There are no wrong answers—I'm trying to understand the real situation, not validate any particular solution."

**Initial prompt**:
"Tell me about the product idea or problem you're thinking about."

## Phase 1: Surface the Struggling Moment

Goal: Find the specific trigger when the job arises.

| Question | What You're Learning |
|----------|---------------------|
| "Walk me through a specific moment when someone hits this problem" | Circumstance detail |
| "What just happened right before that moment?" | Trigger event |
| "Where are they when this happens?" | Context |
| "How often does this situation occur?" | Frequency |
| "What's at stake if they don't solve it?" | Urgency/importance |

**Follow-up probes**:
- "Can you be more specific about who this person is?"
- "What makes this moment particularly frustrating?"
- "Tell me more about what they're feeling right then"

## Phase 2: Understand Current Workarounds

Goal: Learn what people hire today to do this job.

| Question | What You're Learning |
|----------|---------------------|
| "What do people do today when they face this?" | Current solutions |
| "What's cobbled together or hacked?" | Workaround creativity |
| "What do they Google or search for?" | Language they use |
| "Who do they ask for help?" | Social solutions |
| "What do they just... tolerate?" | Unmet job |

**Follow-up probes**:
- "Why doesn't that work well enough?"
- "How much time/money do they spend on workarounds?"
- "What specifically makes the current approach frustrating?"

## Phase 3: Unpack Job Dimensions

Goal: Understand functional, emotional, and social layers.

### Functional
| Question |
|----------|
| "What task are they literally trying to accomplish?" |
| "What would 'done' look like?" |
| "What's the minimum viable outcome?" |

### Emotional
| Question |
|----------|
| "How do they feel when they hit this problem?" |
| "How do they want to feel after solving it?" |
| "What anxiety does this situation create?" |

### Social
| Question |
|----------|
| "Who else sees them dealing with this?" |
| "How do they want to be perceived?" |
| "What would success look like to others?" |

## Phase 4: Map the Forces

Goal: Understand what drives or blocks switching.

### Push (pain of current)
- "What's the worst part of how things work today?"
- "What would they pay to make this pain go away?"

### Pull (appeal of new)
- "If a solution existed, what would make them excited about it?"
- "What would the ideal outcome look like?"

### Anxiety (fear of new)
- "What would make them hesitate to try something new?"
- "What could go wrong if they switched?"
- "What would they need to believe before trying?"

### Habit (comfort of current)
- "What's tolerable about the current approach?"
- "What would they miss if they switched?"
- "What's the path of least resistance?"

## Phase 5: Explore Hiring Criteria

Goal: Understand what makes someone switch.

| Question |
|----------|
| "What would a solution need to do to be worth trying?" |
| "What's the deal-breaker that would make them reject something?" |
| "How would they evaluate if it's working?" |
| "What would make them tell someone else about it?" |

## Phase 6: Synthesis Check

Goal: Reflect understanding back for validation.

**Template**:
"Let me play back what I'm hearing. When [circumstance], you want to [progress] so you can [outcome]. The functional job is [X], but emotionally you want to feel [Y], and you want others to see [Z]. Currently you're using [workaround] but it fails because [limitation]. Does that capture it?"

**Refinement probes**:
- "What did I miss?"
- "What would you emphasize more?"
- "Is there a dimension I'm underweighting?"

## Phase 7: Identify Opportunities

Goal: Surface product implications.

| Question |
|----------|
| "Where's the biggest gap between what exists and what's needed?" |
| "What's the smallest thing that would make a meaningful difference?" |
| "If you had to bet on one approach, what would it be? Why?" |
| "What assumption, if wrong, would invalidate this direction?" |

## Session Closing

**Synthesize job statement**:
```
When [circumstance], [user] wants to [progress], so they can [outcome].
```

**Identify next steps**:
- What needs validation?
- What data would change your view?
- What's the simplest test of this hypothesis?

## Interview Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "Would you use X?" | Hypothetical = unreliable | "Tell me about last time..." |
| "Do you like this idea?" | Validation seeking | "What concerns you about it?" |
| Leading questions | Biased answers | Open-ended prompts |
| Interrupting | Lose depth | Let them finish, then probe |
| Too many questions at once | Overwhelm | 2-3 max, then pause |
