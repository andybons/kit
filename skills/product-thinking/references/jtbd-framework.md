# Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

Based on Clayton Christensen's "Competing Against Luck" methodology.

## Core Premise

Customers don't buy products—they **hire** them to make progress in specific circumstances. Products that succeed understand the job; products that fail focus on features or demographics.

## The Job Definition

A job is:
- The progress a person seeks in a given circumstance
- Functional, emotional, and social dimensions combined
- Stable over time (jobs don't change; solutions do)

A job is NOT:
- A feature request
- A demographic trait
- A use case or user story
- A need (too abstract)

## Job Dimensions

### Functional Job
The practical task to accomplish.
- "Get from A to B quickly"
- "File my taxes accurately"
- "Find information I need"

### Emotional Job
How I want to feel during/after.
- "Feel confident I didn't miss anything"
- "Feel in control of my finances"
- "Reduce my anxiety about this decision"

### Social Job
How I want to be perceived.
- "Look competent to my boss"
- "Seem like a good parent"
- "Appear successful to peers"

**Key insight**: Products often fail by over-indexing on functional and ignoring emotional/social.

## The Four Forces

Progress requires overcoming inertia. Four forces determine whether someone switches:

```
         DEMAND GENERATION                    DEMAND REDUCTION
    ┌─────────────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │                         │          │                         │
    │   PUSH                  │          │   ANXIETY               │
    │   Pain of current       │          │   Fear of new solution  │
    │   situation             │    vs    │                         │
    │                         │          │   "What if it doesn't   │
    │   "This is broken"      │          │    work?"               │
    │                         │          │                         │
    ├─────────────────────────┤          ├─────────────────────────┤
    │                         │          │                         │
    │   PULL                  │          │   HABIT                 │
    │   Appeal of new         │          │   Comfort of current    │
    │   solution              │    vs    │                         │
    │                         │          │   "I know how this      │
    │   "That looks better"   │          │    works"               │
    │                         │          │                         │
    └─────────────────────────┘          └─────────────────────────┘
```

**For switching to occur**: Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit

## Struggling Moments

The job "arises" in specific circumstances. Identify:

1. **When** does the struggle happen? (time, trigger)
2. **Where** are they? (context, environment)
3. **What** just happened? (preceding event)
4. **Who** else is involved? (social context)

**Example**: "When I'm in a meeting and someone asks a question I should know the answer to" → triggers job of "look competent without admitting ignorance"

## Hiring and Firing

Customers hire products for jobs. They fire products when:
- Job changes (rare—jobs are stable)
- Better solution appears for same job
- Circumstances change
- Product drifts from the job it was hired for

**Interview for firing**: "Tell me about a product you stopped using. What was the moment you decided to switch?"

## Circumstance Segmentation

Traditional segmentation (demographics, firmographics) doesn't predict behavior. **Circumstance-based segmentation** does:

| Traditional | Circumstance-Based |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Millennials aged 25-34" | "First-time homebuyers who feel overwhelmed by the process" |
| "Enterprise companies" | "Teams scaling past 50 people where informal communication breaks down" |
| "Working parents" | "Parents in the 15 minutes before school pickup who need to feel organized" |

## Red Flags in JTBD Research

| What You Hear | What's Wrong | Better Question |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| "I need a faster X" | Solution bias | "What were you trying to accomplish when you wanted faster X?" |
| "I want feature Y" | Feature request | "What would having Y let you do that you can't do now?" |
| "Everyone wants this" | No circumstance | "Tell me about a specific person and moment" |
| "Our users are..." | Demographic thinking | "Walk me through the last time someone hired your product" |

## Job Story Format

**Template**:
```
When [circumstance + trigger],
I want to [make this progress],
So I can [achieve this outcome / feel this way].
```

**Weak Example**:
"When I'm hungry, I want to eat food, so I can be full."
(Too generic—applies to everyone always)

**Strong Example**:
"When I'm commuting to work and realize I skipped breakfast, I want to eat something filling that doesn't make a mess in my car, so I can arrive at work focused instead of distracted by hunger."
(Specific circumstance, reveals functional + emotional dimensions)

## Competing with Non-Consumption

The biggest competitor is often **nothing**. People tolerate bad situations rather than adopt new solutions because:
- Anxiety of new > Pain of current
- Don't know solutions exist
- Job seems unsolvable
- Switching cost feels too high

**Questions for non-consumption**:
- "What do people do when they hit this problem and just... give up?"
- "Who has this job but isn't hiring anything?"
- "What makes people decide this problem isn't worth solving?"
