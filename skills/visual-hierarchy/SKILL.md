# Visual Hierarchy in UX

Visual hierarchy refers to the organization of design elements so that the eye is guided to consume each element in order of intended importance. A page's visual hierarchy directs where users focus their attention and controls information delivery.

## Three Primary Methods

### 1. Color and Contrast

Use color saturation and value differences to make certain elements advance while others recede. Type contrast through bold weights, italics, or underlines also signals importance.

**Best Practices:**
- Reserve bright, warm colors (like red) for warnings or errors
- Limit designs to 2 primary and 2 secondary colors to avoid overwhelming users
- Use no more than 3 contrast variations in complex designs
- Never rely solely on color; account for color-blind users

### 2. Scale

Larger elements naturally attract attention and signal greater importance. Size serves as a direct marker for priority.

**Best Practices:**
- Employ only 3 size variations (small, medium, large)
- Make the most important element the largest
- Limit to a maximum of 2 large elements so they genuinely stand out
- Suggested web ranges: 14-16px body, 18-22px subheader, 32px+ header

### 3. Grouping (Proximity and Common Regions)

Implicit grouping through whitespace and explicit grouping via borders or backgrounds help users understand page structure and navigate attention strategically.

**Best Practices:**
- Increase spacing between distinct groups
- Decrease spacing between related elements
- Use containers sparingly to avoid clutter

## The Squint Test

Apply blur to designs to reveal underlying hierarchy and uncover unintended emphasis caused by strong content colors. This technique highlights whether groupings work as intended.
